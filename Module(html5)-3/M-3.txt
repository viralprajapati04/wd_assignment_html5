<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>

<header>
<main>
<mark>

Q-2:How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
Ans:To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5,
audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era.
To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release
of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, 
Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari
browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.
Example:
<audio>
    <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
</audio>

To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. 
It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. 
It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. 
Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. 
Example:
<video>
    <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
</video>

Q-3:Semantic element in HTML5?
Ans:Semantic elements in HTML5 are those that clearly describe their
meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Using semantic elements
helps with accessibility, search engine optimization, and code readability.
Here are some key semantic elements:
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<article>
<section>
<aside>
<footer>
<figure>
<figcaption>
<time>

Q-4:Canvas and SVG tags 
Ans:The HTML5 Canvas element provides a space on the web page where 
you can dynamically draw graphics using JavaScript.
Unlike SVG, which is vector-based, Canvas is pixel-based (raster).

Pixel-based: Canvas allows you to draw shapes, images, and text pixel by pixel.
Dynamic: It’s ideal for real-time graphics, such as games, interactive animations, or visual effects.
JavaScript-based: You must use JavaScript to manipulate the canvas and render graphics.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based format used for defining 
two-dimensional vector graphics on the web. Unlike raster images such as 
.jpg, .gif, or .png, SVG images can be scaled to any size without losing quality.

Scalable: SVG images maintain high quality at any resolution, making them ideal 
for logos, icons, and scalable graphics.
Editable: SVG images can be created and edited using any text editor since they 
are based on XML.
Interactive: You can modify SVG graphics using CSS or JavaScript.
